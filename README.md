Inspired by the famous game "Doors" on roblox, where the players goes through rooms 1-100 and tries to hide from entities. I recreated the rooms involving procedurally generated algorithms and randomly placing furniture in the room. LUA which is the language roblox scripting utilizies, is currently NOT object orientated. It was made with module scripts and created objects for each the rooms.
